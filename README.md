## Introduction

Welcome to **Uber-Data-Analysis**! Uber Technologies, Inc. (commonly referred to as Uber) provides ride-hailing services, food delivery, and freight transport. It is headquartered in San Francisco and operates in approximately 70 countries and 10,500 cities worldwide. The company has over 131 million monthly active users and 6 million active drivers and couriers worldwide and facilitates an average of 25 million trips per day. It has facilitated 42 billion trips since its inception in 2010 and is the largest ridesharing company in the United States.

I will ask these questions during the analysis:

How many Categories do we have?
Check how long people travel with Uber?
What Hour Do Most People Take Uber To Their Destination?
Check The Purpose Of Trips
Which Day Has The Highest Number Of Trips
What Are The Number Of Trips Per Each Day?
What Are The Trips In The Month?
